Deliverable 1

For the navbar I copied and pasted the source code for the navbar in one of the examples in 
bootstraps documentation. The changes I made were a home button that takes you to the main page
of bootstrap's website an a github button that takes you to my github page.

The navbar will be compressed into a button if the window is too small to which the user can press
it and show a dropdown menu of the navbar.

As for the main piece, I decided to go with a registration format using a card because I like how
it gives a very clean and simple page to navigate. I decided to keep things simple and added an
area to enter a first name, last name, password, a second password to confirm, and a phone number
with a dropdown menu to select what kind of number the user is entering. Lastly a checkbox to
agree with the terms and conditions and once form is completed, the user will click 'submit'.
